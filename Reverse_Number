# Q2. Write a program to reverse an array in place? In place means you cannot create a new array. You have to update the original array.

def reverseList(A):
  print( A[::-1])
     
# Driver function to test above function
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(A)
print("Reversed list is")
reverseList(A) 


# Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Reversed list is
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
